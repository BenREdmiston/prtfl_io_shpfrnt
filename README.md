HQ Static Site - Digital Product Shopfront - Portfolio


📘 Digital Product Landing Page (Portfolio Project)
A high-performance, mobile-responsive landing page designed for selling digital assets. This project demonstrates a "Lean Tech Stack" approach—prioritizing speed, SEO, and cost-efficiency.

🛠️ The Tech Stack
Frontend: Semantic HTML5 & Modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid).

Typography: Inter (via Google Fonts API) for maximum readability.

Deployment: Netlify with Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

Workflow: Built entirely using Cloud-based IDEs (GitHub Dev/VS Code Web), demonstrating a flexible, "develop-from-anywhere" workflow.

💡 Key Features
Mobile-First Design: Fully responsive layout that adapts from smartphone to ultra-wide monitors.

Performance Optimized: Zero JavaScript overhead on initial load, resulting in near-perfect Lighthouse scores.

Commercial Ready: Integrated with external payment processing (Stripe/LemonSqueezy) to bypass complex backend requirements while maintaining security.

🧠 Technical Decisions
Why No Framework? I chose Vanilla HTML/CSS to showcase a deep understanding of the Core Web Vitals. It results in a smaller bundle size and faster Time to Interactive (TTI) compared to heavy JS frameworks for a single landing page.

Why Netlify? Utilized Netlify’s Edge Network to ensure global availability and instant cache invalidation upon every GitHub "Push."
